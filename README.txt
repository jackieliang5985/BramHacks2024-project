BramEvac
Idea: Emergency evacuation system (website) using Brampton Transit. In the case of an emergency,
instead of everyone evacuating in their own car, we can utilize Brampton buses to evacuate people
more efficiently. During the recent Alberta wildfire, we saw the huge lineup of cars waiting to leave.
A singular bus can hold up to 75 people while taking up only as much space as 2 cars.
Therefore, using buses to evacuate people would make the evacuation procedure significantly faster.
The idea is scalable from events including riots and threat situations to natural disasters
in the future due to climate change.
