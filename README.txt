BT Pulse
A real-time transit feedback tool, with information displayed to riders and Brampton Transit
to help improve their services. Users can report an overall rating for the route they ride, alongisde
aspects including departure time, arrival time, overcrowding, and clealiness. The main page will display
all of the Brampton Transit routes. Once you click on your desired route, the page will display a real-time
outage graph, alongside a rating out of 5 stars. Below, you can find an option to submit feedback for the route,
alongside the ratings for the other aspects mentioned. Additionally, if the route is GREEN (electric buses),
we can display a special icon indicating "green travel", which will further encourage riders.
Through analyzing the feedback given, Brampton Transit can implement further measures and policies,
such as replacing routes which have overcrowding with electric buses, to drastically decrease the carbon footprint.
